AeroGP is a Matlab-based computer code that verifies a Nonlinear Finite Response Model based on Gaussian Processes (GP-NFIR) for aerodynamic analyses of linelike structures.
The scripts Example1a_FlatPlateForced.m and Example1b_FlatPlateFlutter.m contain the verification of the model for a Flat Plate.
The folder GP includes an implementation of Gaussian Processes, while the folder Example1_FlatPlateAnalytical contains the details for the analytical flat plate analysis and plots.
The details on of the utilized methods are given in the abovementioned article.
